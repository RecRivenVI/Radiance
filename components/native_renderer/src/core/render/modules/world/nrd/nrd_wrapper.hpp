     * NrdWrapper does not automatically resize its resources and will have to get recreated if the size changes.
     * However, it does support rendering to only a part of the images, as described in the NRD documentation
     * regarding nrd::CommonSettings::resourceSize and nrd::CommonSettings::rectSize.
     *
     * The userTexturePool is a pool of textures that NRD uses as input and output data.
     * Which textures are needed depends on the actual denoiser in use. Refer to NRDDescs.h
     * to find out which textures are needed for which denoiser.
     * To make it an easier interface, we use an array where each slot corresponds to one 'nrd::ResourceType'
     * texture resource. Depending on the denoiser in use, this array will be sparsely populated.
     * 'userTexturePool' (but NOT the textures it contains) will be copied into an internal copy
     * and thus can be discarded after the call.
     *
     * NRD uses two internal pools of textures ("resources"): permanent and transient ones.
     * Permanent textures must not be altered outside of NRD, while transient textures could be
     * reused as (or aliased with) other application specific textures. Albeit, this wrapper
     * does not expose the transient pool to the application and thus makes no use of reusing
     * transient textures for other purposes.
